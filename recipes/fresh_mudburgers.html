    <h1>Fresh Mudburgers</h1>

    <img src="../images/fresh_mudburgers.jpeg" alt="A Roald Dahl character (I'm assuming it's James) holding a tray of mudburgers. You're not missing out on much; they don't look that great.">
    <p>Mud and burgers combined, and somehow they're fresh? I don't know how it works, but it came from James and the Giant Peach by Roald Dahl so you'll
        have to figure it out. No disrespect to the GOAT.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>7 oz of semi-sweet chocolate, broken into small pieces</li>
        <li>4 tbsp (1/2 stick) of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>5 tbsp of light corn syrup</li>
        <li>3 oz of slivered almonds</li>
        <li>6 plain vanilla cookies or graham crackers, finely crushed</li>
        <li>1 oz of Rice Krispies (Rice Bubbles for the people down under)</li>
        <li>A few drops of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of sugar</li>
        <li>2 oz of slivered almonds, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the semisweet chocolate, butter, and corn syrup in a Pyrex bowl and place in a 
            saucepan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until melted. (Or place the bowl in a 
            microwave oven and cook on high for about 1 Â½ minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the almonds, crushed cookies, Rice Krispies, and vanilla extract and mix well.</li>
        <li>Spoon the mixture into a shallow pan lined with wax paper. Press the mixture down 
            firmly with the back of a fork, creating a level surface.</li>
        <li>Refridgerate until cool, then cut into bars.</li>
        <li>Once the bars are ready, make the nutty crunch. Begin by placing the water and sugar in a 
            small saucepan. Cook over low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Do not stir, but occasionally 
            swirl the pan around gently. Once the sugar has dissolved, increase the heat and stir constantly 
            until the sugar caramelizes and turns golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat. Working quickly, add the chopped almonds, stir thoroughly, and dip one end of 
            each bar in the mixture. Place the bars on a sheet of buttered wax paper to set.</li>
        <li>Melt the milk chocolate in a Pyrex bowl set in a saucepan of simmering water, or microwave as above. 
            Once it has melted, remove from the heat and dip the other end of each bar in the chocolate.</li>
        <li>Let the bars cool on a sheet of wax paper.</li>
    </ol>
