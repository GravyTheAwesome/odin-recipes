    <h1>Fresh Mudburgers</h1>

    <img src="../images/fresh_mudburgers.jpeg" alt="A Roald Dahl character (I'm assuming it's James) holding a tray of mudburgers. You're not missing out on much; they don't look that great.">
    <p>Mud and burgers combined, and somehow they're fresh? I don't know how it works, but it came from James and the Giant Peach by Roald Dahl so you'll
        have to figure it out. No disrespect to the GOAT.
